by default I trust the  PasspaortPaking  App and related stuff in Cambridge government and did not worry more about it.

### What happened?   

The parking enforcers will ==never== see my mobile payment on their handheld device

I should not trust them

once I got the tickets I dispute these tickets and completed the dispute form online as the ticket said

I provided my paid records and still trust then can check them in there system. 

### They denied my correspondence after "carefull" review

### There is not any detailed info about why my dispute is denied. 

### What should I do? 

"if requesting a hearing, .... Cambridge, MA".

I am in San Jose, CA.  

##### My options: 

- request hearing:  cost will include time any payment for the plane tickets from CA to MA. I think they 

  find this when they "careful review"! 

- pay the "FINE":  That means I agree I did not pay those parking lots.  will Lost my reputation and good credit records history
